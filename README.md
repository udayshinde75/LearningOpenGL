This repository contains all my practice code, experiments, and projects as I learn OpenGL for computer graphics and real-time rendering.
I’m exploring the fundamentals including shaders, buffers, VAOs/VBOs, transformations, lighting, textures, and more.
The goal is to build a strong foundation in modern OpenGL and gradually move toward advanced graphics programming.
